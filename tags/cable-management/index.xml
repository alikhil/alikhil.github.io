      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey!
Eventually, my desk got pretty messy with all the cables and other stuff piled up on it. Also, my cats started playing with and gnawing on wires. So, I decided to reorganize everything on my desk. Check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!---more---&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got a medium-sized table, about 120 by 80 cm. It&amp;rsquo;s wide (deep) but not too long. I need to keep everything in order and clean so I can work comfortably.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

<p>I&rsquo;ve got a medium-sized table, about 120 by 80 cm. It&rsquo;s wide (deep) but not too long. I need to keep everything in order and clean so I can work comfortably.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what my setup looked like before I made all the changes I mentioned.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/posts/cable-management/before-front.jpg" type="" alt="setup before reorganization"  /></p>
<p>As you can see, I&rsquo;ve got a work laptop, a Mac mini, a monitor on its own stand, a journal, AirPods, and a few other things. I also bought a USB switch at some point because I got tired of plugging and unplugging my webcam manually in my <a href="https://alikhil.dev/posts/how-to-use-3-computers-without-kvm/">KVM-less setup</a>.</p>
<h2 id="heres-what-ive-done">Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve done</h2>
<ul>
<li>I mounted the monitor to the arm, which freed up space below the screen.</li>
<li>I set up my Mac mini under the table.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve got my MacBook pro mounted under the table.</li>
<li>I installed the USB hub into the monitor arm. It&rsquo;s a solid connection point, but the switch button on it is a bit uncomfortable to press. So,</li>
<li>Put the extended switch button under the table, close to the chair.</li>
<li>There&rsquo;s a mounted headphones holder under the table.</li>
<li>The cables that ran next to each other were routed through the sleeves.</li>
<li>Bind cables together with hook and loops tie</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="list-of-things-that-ive-used">List of things that I&rsquo;ve used</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://a.aliexpress.com/_Ewdgm1c">The cable sleeve</a> is super handy for binding the cables together!</li>
<li><a href="https://a.aliexpress.com/_EvYuv3M">This cable sleeve</a> is a bit pricey, but it lets you pull cables out from the middle without damaging it.</li>
<li><a href="https://a.aliexpress.com/_EyRlHBM">MacBook under desk mount support</a>. Antiscratch stickers came loose at the second day. So donâ€™t recommend this one.</li>
<li><a href="https://a.aliexpress.com/_EuW6yMS">Mac Mini under desk support</a></li>
<li><a href="https://a.aliexpress.com/_EJvesWI">Hook and loops tie</a></li>
<li><a href="https://a.aliexpress.com/_EQ3DlES">Cable clips</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.flexispot.es/monitor-mount-fits-10-27.html">Adjustable monitor support arm</a></li>
</ul>
