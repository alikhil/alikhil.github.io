      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you as me have single monitor and 2 Mac devices (for example, I have corporate Macbook and personal Mac Mini) you may want to use the same monitor for both devices. And you may want to switch between them without unplugging and plugging cables or selecting input source using monitor buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post I will show you how to configure hotkeys for that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you as me have single monitor and 2 Mac devices (for example, I have corporate Macbook and personal Mac Mini) you may want to use the same monitor for both devices. And you may want to switch between them without unplugging and plugging cables or selecting input source using monitor buttons.</p>
<p>In this post I will show you how to configure hotkeys for that.</p>
<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>
<p>You will need a monitor with <strong>multiple input sources</strong>.
For example, I have Dell S2722QC tt has 2 HDMI ports and 1 USB-C port where:</p>
<ul>
<li>Macbook Air connected to port HDMI-2</li>
<li>Mac Mini connected to port USB-C-1</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="software">Software</h2>
<p>There is app called <a href="https://github.com/waydabber/BetterDisplay">BetterDisplay</a> that has a lot of powerful features. But for our case we need only one feature - <strong>change display inputs using DDC</strong>.</p>
<p>Install it on both Macs. You will have 14 days trial period with all PRO features.</p>
<p><strong>Enable Accessibility for BetterDisplay in System Settings -&gt; Privacy &amp; Security -&gt; Accessibility.</strong></p>
<p>Then try to switch input source by clicking on BetterDisplay icon in the menu bar -&gt; <em>DDC Input Source -&gt; Select next port.</em></p>
<table>
  <thead>
      <tr>
          <th></th>
          <th></th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td><img loading="lazy" src="/images/posts/menu-shot.png" type="" alt="Menu Shot"  /></td>
          <td><img loading="lazy" src="/images/posts/input-choose.png" type="" alt="Input Choose"  /></td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>If it works, you can continue to the next step.
Otherwise check if your monitor supports DDC protocol and ensure Accessibility is enabled for BetterDisplay.</p>
<h3 id="paid-option">Paid option</h3>
<p>If you are ready to pay 19$/19‚Ç¨ x2 for both Macs you can <a href="https://betterdisplay.pro/buy/">buy BetterDisplay</a>. And then configure hotkeys in the app settings <em>Settings -&gt; Keyboards -&gt; Custom keyboard shortcuts -&gt; DDC Input Source</em>.</p>
<p>Click &ldquo;Record Shortcut&rdquo; and press the key combination you want to use, for example <code>CMD + F1</code> and <code>CMD + F2</code>.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/posts/shortcuts.png" type="" alt="alt text"  /></p>
<h3 id="free-option">Free option</h3>
<p>If you like me don&rsquo;t want to pay for 40$ for single feature there is a hacky way to do it.</p>
<p>We need an app that can handle hotkeys and run shell commands. I use <a href="https://www.raycast.com/">Raycast</a>, so called &ldquo;Spotlight on steroids&rdquo; and it can handle custom hotkeys. Or you can use any other app you like.</p>
<h4 id="configuring-shell-command">Configuring shell command</h4>
<p>Before configuring <strong>Raycast</strong> we need to know <code>ddc</code> value for each input source. To do so, go to <em>Settings -&gt; Displays -&gt; &ldquo;Your monitor name&rdquo; -&gt; DDC Input Sources</em>, and save IDs from <strong>Value</strong> column for each input source:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/posts/ddc-input-sources.png" type="" alt="alt text"  /></p>
<p>In my case it&rsquo;s <code>18</code> for HDMI-2 and <code>25</code> for USB-C-1.</p>
<p>Then create a directory <code>~/raycast-scripts</code> and put there a script <code>change-input-source.sh</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="cp">#!/bin/bash

<h4 id="configuring-raycast">Configuring Raycast</h4>
<ol>
<li>Open Raycast and go to <em>Settings -&gt; Extensions -&gt; Search for Scripts</em></li>
<li>Click on <em>Add Script Directory</em> and select <code>~/raycast-scripts</code></li>
<li>Click on <em>Record Shortcut</em> for newly added script and press the key combination you want to use, for example <code>CMD + F1</code> on first Mac and <code>CMD + F2</code> on second.</li>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you expected only post on IT topics on this blog, I am sorry :(
Today I&amp;rsquo;ll share you my experience in learning a new language. I am practicing these techniques and tips for mastering Espa√±ol, but I am sure that you can apply them to most of the other languages.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you expected only post on IT topics on this blog, I am sorry :(
Today I&rsquo;ll share you my experience in learning a new language. I am practicing these techniques and tips for mastering Espa√±ol, but I am sure that you can apply them to most of the other languages.</p>
<h1 id="gamification">Gamification</h1>
<p>If you are only starting to learn then this will be helpful for you in double. Most of the people give up learning after several weeks or even days after they begin. It&rsquo;s because of their motivation. It becomes lower with time. And in the beginning when you know almost nothing and understand that you should work hard and work a lot to learn. It really demotivates. And I think elements of gamification will help to increase motivation and turn learning process to habit. You can gamify your learning in any way you want. I recommend:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.duolingo.com/">Duolingo</a> or <a href="https://lingualeo.com/">Linguoleo</a> - good for learning the basics of the language</li>
<li><a href="https://tinycards.duolingo.com/">Tinycard</a> - for learning/memorizing new words</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="listen">Listen</h1>
<p>As soon as you have learned basics, start listening to podcasts. There are some free audio podcasts oriented for beginners. For example, in Spanish, it&rsquo;s a <a href="https://www.notesinspanish.com/">Notes in Spanish</a>.</p>
<p>Create a playlist with up to 20 songs you like on language you learn and listen to them regularly. And keep listening until you will understand what a song about. You don&rsquo;t have to translate all the words in each song. In fact, It is not very useful. But opposite, when you learn new words from textbook, tinycard or from anywhere else and you hear this word while you are listening to your playlist you learn better.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ndash; Oh, wait. I know what this word means &hellip;</p></blockquote>
<h1 id="watch">Watch</h1>
<p>If you are fun of TV-shows, you can start watching them in the language you learn. With subtitles or without them. Of course, it requires some basic knowledge. If you care that you will miss some key points of the story and prefer to fully understand it, you can watch sitcoms which don&rsquo;t have almost anything in common between series.</p>]]></content:encoded>
