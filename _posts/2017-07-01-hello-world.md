This is my first post here. And after spending about 4 hours on making blog work I want to share with you first hack.
If you want to create blog with Jekyll, then **use github (https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-the-jekyll-theme-chooser/)[tutorial]**. 

I tried 2 or three different tutorials, they were complicated and non of them worked for me. But when I used github tutorial, it took 5 minutes for me to make it working!

Quick overview of tutorial:

1. Create new repository with name like `username.github.io`.
2. Navigate to repository **Settings**
3. Click **Chose a theme**
4. Enjoy your blog!
