You‚Äôll need a Linux machine that‚Äôs always online, connected to the internet, and about $10.\nWhat You‚Äôll Need A physical SIM card A USB modem that‚Äôs supported by the Gammu library A Telegram bot token, chat or channel ID A Linux machine with a free USB port Docker and Docker Compose installed Finding the Right Modem If you have a USB modem at home, check if it‚Äôs supported by Gammu.\nFor our purposes, we don‚Äôt need an expensive 4G modem with advanced features. Any basic 2G/3G modem will work, and these are easy to find at a discounted price on sites like eBay or Wallapop.\nSearch for ‚ÄúHuawei USB modem,‚Äù sort by price, and look for unlocked options or ones with compatible firmware.\nFor instance: Next, go to the Gammu website and look up the device. Make sure it appears on the list and that ‚ÄúSMS‚Äù is included in the \u0026ldquo;Supported features\u0026rdquo; column:\nIf the device meets these requirements, it‚Äôs good to go!\nSetup Instructions Before starting the setup, it‚Äôs best to connect the modem with the SIM card already inserted to your PC and check that it‚Äôs functioning properly.\nIdentify Device Path Run the following command to identify the device path:\ntree /dev/serial/by-id/ You should see a paths similar to:\n/dev/serial/by-id ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ usb-HUAWEI_HUAWEI_Mobile-if00-port0 -\u0026gt; ../../ttyUSB0 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ usb-HUAWEI_HUAWEI_Mobile-if02-port0 -\u0026gt; ../../ttyUSB1 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ usb-HUAWEI_HUAWEI_Mobile-if03-port0 -\u0026gt; ../../ttyUSB2 Choose a path that ends with ttyUSB0, in my case it\u0026rsquo;s /dev/serial/by-id/usb-HUAWEI_HUAWEI_Mobile-if00-port0.\nRunning the Service Using Docker Compose, set up your configuration:\nservices: gammu: build: context: https://github.com/kutovoys/sms-to-telegram.git#main dockerfile: Dockerfile.alpine volumes: - type: bind source: /dev/serial/by-id/usb-HUAWEI_HUAWEI_Mobile-if00-port0 # Change this to your device path target: /dev/modem privileged: true environment: - BOT_TOKEN=\u0026lt;put your telegram bot token here\u0026gt; - PIN=\u0026lt;your sim card pin\u0026gt; - CHAT_ID=\u0026lt;telegram chat/channel ID\u0026gt; - DEVICE=/dev/modem cap_add: - NET_ADMIN - SYS_MODULE Save the configuration to a docker-compose.yml file and run:\ndocker compose up -d docker compose logs -f gammu If everything is set up correctly, you should see the following log messages:\ngammu-1 | Fri 2024/10/04 17:50:56 gammu-smsd[12]: Created POSIX RW shared memory at 0x7fcf90b21000 gammu-1 | Fri 2024/10/04 17:50:56 gammu-smsd[12]: Starting phone communication... gammu-1 | Fri 2024/10/04 17:55:30 gammu-smsd[12]: Ignoring incoming SMS info as not a Status Report in SR memory. gammu-1 | Fri 2024/10/04 17:55:33 gammu-smsd[12]: Read 1 messages gammu-1 | Fri 2024/10/04 17:55:33 gammu-smsd[12]: Received IN20241004_195517_00_Celerity_00.txt gammu-1 | Fri 2024/10/04 17:55:33 gammu-smsd[13]: Starting run on receive: /etc/sms_to_telegram.sh IN20241004_195517_00_Celerity_00.txt gammu-1 | Fri 2024/10/04 17:55:33 gammu-smsd[12]: Process finished successfully To test SMS reception, you can use free online SMS-sending services (search for \u0026ldquo;send SMS for free\u0026rdquo;) or try logging into Telegram, your bank account, etc.\nHow It Works The Gammu library provides a unified interface for working with phones and modems from various manufacturers.\nOn top of that, there\u0026rsquo;s the Gammu SMS Daemon, which receives SMS messages and triggers a custom script‚Äîin our case, script to send the messages to Telegram.\nFinal Thoughts Thanks to @kutovoys for the idea and Docker image!\nThis is a simple, affordable, and scalable solution‚Äîespecially if you‚Äôre into self-hosting.\nThis post was originally written for vas3k.club.\n","permalink":"https://alik.page/posts/forwarding-sms-to-telegram/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAfter extensive travel, I‚Äôve accumulated several mobile numbers and, naturally, physical SIM cards.

For example, I have Dell S2722QC tt has 2 HDMI ports and 1 USB-C port where:\nMacbook Air connected to port HDMI-2 Mac Mini connected to port USB-C-1 Software There is app called BetterDisplay that has a lot of powerful features.

Not long time ago, there was release of new 1.0 version of drone. Which brang a lot of cool features and new license. The license tells that we can use Enterprise version of drone for free without any limits by building our own docker image if we are individuals or startup (read the licence for more detail).\nSo, how to build it?\nInstructions First, clone the drone repo to your local machine.\ngit clone git@github.com:drone/drone.git Second, checkout to version of drone you want to build. For example, I want to build v1.3.1:\ngit checkout v1.3.1 We will use single dockerfile to build the image. To do so, we need to add extra step to existing dockerfile which is in docker directory. Let\u0026rsquo;s say we want to build docker image for linux OS and amd64 architecture, then we will edit docker/Dockerfile.server.linux.amd64.\nIf you check the dockerfile you will see, that binaries are just copied into docker image during the build and they are built outside of the docker build. So, the step we will add to dockerfile is go build step.\nTo build the binary, we need to know what version of go is used for building binary in original docker image. We can find it in drone.yml build step. For version 1.3.1 of drone golang:1.12.9 docker image is used for building binaries.\nThen, we use same image to build binary in our dockerfile:\ndocker/Dockerfile.server.linux.amd64\nFROM golang:1.12.9 as builder WORKDIR /go/src/github.com/drone/drone COPY . . ENV GOOS linux ENV GOARCH amd64 ENV CGO_ENABLED 1 ENV REPO github.com/drone/drone ENV GO111MODULE on RUN go build -tags nolimit -ldflags \u0026#34;-extldflags \\\u0026#34;-static\\\u0026#34;\u0026#34; -o release/linux/${GOARCH}/drone-server ${REPO}/cmd/drone-server FROM alpine:3.9 as alpine RUN apk add -U --no-cache ca-certificates FROM alpine:3.9 EXPOSE 80 443 VOLUME /data ENV GODEBUG netdns=go ENV XDG_CACHE_HOME /data ENV DRONE_DATABASE_DRIVER sqlite3 ENV DRONE_DATABASE_DATASOURCE /data/database.sqlite ENV DRONE_RUNNER_OS=linux ENV DRONE_RUNNER_ARCH=amd64 ENV DRONE_SERVER_PORT=:80 ENV DRONE_SERVER_HOST=localhost ENV DRONE_DATADOG_ENABLED=true ENV DRONE_DATADOG_ENDPOINT=https://stats.drone.ci/api/v1/series COPY --from=alpine /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt /etc/ssl/certs/ COPY --from=builder /go/src/github.com/drone/drone/release/linux/amd64/drone-server /bin/ ENTRYPOINT [\u0026#34;/bin/drone-server\u0026#34;] Also we need to delete .dockerignore file from root of the repo.\nrm .dockerignore Then we build docker image like:\ndocker build -t alikhil/drone:1.3.1 -f docker/Dockerfile.server.linux.amd64 .

Tutorial is oriented for those don\u0026rsquo;t very familiar with docker and k8s but want their single page application run in k8s.\nDockerize the application I expect that you have docker installed in your machine. If it isn\u0026rsquo;t you can install it by following official installation guide.\nAs SPA project I will use vue-realworld-example-app as SPA project. You can your own SPA project if you have one.\nSo, I have cloned it, installed dependencies and built:\ngit clone https://github.com/gothinkster/vue-realworld-example-app yarn yarn build Next step is to decide how our application will be served. There are bunch of possible solutions but I decided to use nginx since it recommends itself as one of the best http servers.\nTo serve SPA we need to return all requested files if they exist or otherwise fallback to index.html. To do so I wrote the following nginx config:\nnginx.conf\n# ... # other configs server { listen 80; root /app; location / { alias /app/; try_files $uri /index.html; } } Full config file can be found in my fork of the repo\nThen, we need to write Dockerfile for building image with our application. Here it is:\nFROM nginx WORKDIR /root/ COPY ./dist /app COPY ./nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf We assume that artifacts of build placed in the dist directory and so that during the docker build the content of dist directory copied into containers /app directory.\nNow, we are ready to build it:\ndocker build -t alikhil/my-spa:0.1 . And run it:\ndocker run -p 8080:80 alikhil/my-spa:0.1 Then if we open http://localhost:8080 we will see something similar to:\nCool! It works!\nWe will need to use our newly builded docker image to deploy to k8s. So, we need to make it available from the k8s cluster by pulling to some docker registry. I will push image to DockerHub:\ndocker push alikhil/my-spa:0.1 Deploy to k8s To run the application in k8s we will use Deployment resource type. Here it is:\ndeployment.yaml\napiVersion: extensions/v1beta1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: my-spa labels: app: my-spa spec: replicas: 1 template: metadata: labels: app: my-spa spec: containers: - image: alikhil/my-spa:0.1 name: spa ports: - containerPort: 80 resources: limits: cpu: 150m memory: 250Mi Then we create deployment by running kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml and newly created pods can found:\n$ kubectl get pods NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE my-spa-84b6dcd48d-mhv9f 1/1 Running 0 18s Then we need to expose our app to the world. It can be done by using service of type NodePort or via Ingress. We will do it with Ingress. For that we will need service:\nservice.yaml\napiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: name: my-spa labels: app: my-spa spec: type: ClusterIP ports: - port: 80 targetPort: 80 protocol: TCP name: http selector: app: my-spa And ingress itself:\ningress.yaml\napiVersion: extensions/v1beta1 kind: Ingress metadata: name: my-spa-ing annotations: kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx spec: tls: - hosts: - my-spa.example.com secretName: my-spa-cert-secret rules: - host: my-spa.example.com http: paths: - path: / backend: serviceName: my-spa servicePort: 80 kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml -f service.yaml And here it is!

I am practicing these techniques and tips for mastering Espa√±ol, but I am sure that you can apply them to most of the other languages.\nGamification If you are only starting to learn then this will be helpful for you in double. Most of the people give up learning after several weeks or even days after they begin. It\u0026rsquo;s because of their motivation. It becomes lower with time. And in the beginning when you know almost nothing and understand that you should work hard and work a lot to learn. It really demotivates. And I think elements of gamification will help to increase motivation and turn learning process to habit. You can gamify your learning in any way you want. I recommend:\nDuolingo or Linguoleo - good for learning the basics of the language Tinycard - for learning/memorizing new words Listen As soon as you have learned basics, start listening to podcasts. There are some free audio podcasts oriented for beginners. For example, in Spanish, it\u0026rsquo;s a Notes in Spanish.\nCreate a playlist with up to 20 songs you like on language you learn and listen to them regularly. And keep listening until you will understand what a song about. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to translate all the words in each song. In fact, It is not very useful. But opposite, when you learn new words from textbook, tinycard or from anywhere else and you hear this word while you are listening to your playlist you learn better.\n\u0026ndash; Oh, wait. I know what this word means \u0026hellip;\nWatch If you are fun of TV-shows, you can start watching them in the language you learn. With subtitles or without them. Of course, it requires some basic knowledge. If you care that you will miss some key points of the story and prefer to fully understand it, you can watch sitcoms which don\u0026rsquo;t have almost anything in common between series.\n","permalink":"https://alik.page/posts/how-to-start-learning-new-language/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIf you expected only post on IT topics on this blog, I am sorry :(\nToday I\u0026rsquo;ll share you my experience in learning a new language.

We have internal services in our k8s cluster that we want to be accessible for developers. It can be kubernetes-dashboard or kibana or anything else.\nBefore that we used Basic Auth, it\u0026rsquo;s easy to setup in ingresses. But this approach has several disadvantages:\nWe need to share a single pair of login and password for all services among all developers Developers will be asked to enter credentials each time when they access service first time What we want is that developer will log in once and will have access to all other services without additional authentication.\nSo, a possible scenario could be:\nDevelopers open https://kibana.example.com which is internal service Browser redirects them to https://auth.example.com where they sign in After successful authentication browser redirects them to https://kibana.example.com Preparation Update UPD 1.0(07/30/18) Using kube-lego for configuring Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt certificates is depricated now. Consider using cert-manager instead.\nUPD 2.0(08/24/18) Initialy, when I was writing this post I was using old version of nginx 0.9.0, because it did not work correctly on newer version.

I will use the newly created cluster in Google Cloud Platform with version 1.8.10-gke.0. If you have a cluster with configured ingress and https you can skip this step.\nThen we need to install nginx ingress and kube lego. Let\u0026rsquo;s do it using helm:\nInit helm With RBAC:\n# giving default accout admin role: ACCOUNT=$(gcloud info --format=\u0026#39;value(config.account)\u0026#39;) kubectl create clusterrolebinding owner-cluster-admin-binding \\ --clusterrole cluster-admin \\ --user $ACCOUNT kubectl -n kube-system create sa tiller kubectl create clusterrolebinding tiller --clusterrole cluster-admin --serviceaccount=kube-system:tiller helm init --service-account tiller without RBAC:\nhelm init Install nginx-ingress helm install stable/nginx-ingress --name nginx-ing --namespace nginx-ing \\ --set controller.image.repository=gcr.io/google_containers/nginx-ingress-controller \\ --set controller.image.tag=\u0026#34;0.9.0-beta.15\u0026#34; --set rbac.create=true # if RBAC is enabled in the cluster # see all options here: https://github.com/kubernetes/charts/blob/master/stable/nginx-ingress/values.yaml After it\u0026rsquo;s installed we can retrieve controller IP address:\nkubectl --namespace nginx-ing get services -o wide -w nginx-ing-nginx-ingress-controller and create DNS record to point our domain and subdomains to this IP address.\nA example.com xxx.xxx.xx.xxx CNAME *.example.com example.com Install kube-lego helm install --name kube-lego stable/kube-lego --namespace kube-lego \\ --set config.LEGO_SUPPORTED_INGRESS_CLASS=nginx \\ --set config.LEGO_SUPPORTED_INGRESS_PROVIDER=nginx \\ --set config.LEGO_DEFAULT_INGRESS_CLASS=nginx \\ --set config.LEGO_URL=https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/directory \\ --set rbac.create=true \\ --set image.tag=0.1.5 \\ --set config.LEGO_LOG_LEVEL=debug Test it!

The problem is that such functionality has not implemented yet.\nActualy there are several PRs that solve that problem but seems to be they frozen for an unknown amount of time.\nSo, the only thing I could do is to merge one of the PRs to current master and build own image.\nYou also can use my image, but if you worry about security just clone my fork and build image yourself.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s create a namespace and set it as current:\nkubectl create ns oauth-proxy kns oauth-proxy # I am using kubectx tool -\u0026gt; https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx Deploy secret secret.yml\napiVersion: v1 kind: Secret metadata: name: oauth-proxy-secret namespace: oauth-proxy data: github-client-id: base64(YOUR_CLIENT_ID) github-client-secret: base64(YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET) cookie-secret: base64(random_string) kubectl create -f secret.yml Deploy deployment oauth-proxy.deployment.yml\napiVersion: extensions/v1beta1 kind: Deployment metadata: labels: k8s-app: oauth2-proxy name: oauth2-proxy namespace: oauth-proxy spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: k8s-app: oauth2-proxy template: metadata: labels: k8s-app: oauth2-proxy spec: containers: - name: oauth2-proxy image: alikhil/oauth2_proxy:2.2.2 imagePullPolicy: Always args: - --provider=github - --email-domain=* - --upstream=file:///dev/null - --http-address=0.0.0.0:4180 - --whitelist-domain=.example.com - --cookie-domain=.example.com # - --cookie-expire duration: expire timeframe for cookie (default 168h0m0s) # - --cookie-name string: the name of the cookie that the oauth_proxy creates (default \u0026#34;_oauth2_proxy\u0026#34;) # - --cookie-refresh duration: refresh the cookie after this duration; 0 to disable # - --cookie-secret string: the seed string for secure cookies (optionally base64 encoded) env: - name: OAUTH2_PROXY_CLIENT_ID valueFrom: secretKeyRef: name: oauth-proxy-secret key: github-client-id - name: OAUTH2_PROXY_CLIENT_SECRET valueFrom: secretKeyRef: name: oauth-proxy-secret key: github-client-secret - name: OAUTH2_PROXY_COOKIE_SECRET valueFrom: secretKeyRef: name: oauth-proxy-secret key: cookie-secret ports: - containerPort: 4180 protocol: TCP kubectl create -f oauth-proxy.deployment.yml Deploy service oauth-service.yml\napiVersion: v1 kind: Service metadata: labels: k8s-app: oauth2-proxy name: oauth2-proxy namespace: oauth-proxy spec: type: NodePort ports: - name: http port: 4180 protocol: TCP targetPort: 4180 selector: k8s-app: oauth2-proxy kubectl create -f oauth-service.yml Deploy ingress oauth-ing.yml\napiVersion: extensions/v1beta1 kind: Ingress metadata: name: oauth2-proxy namespace: oauth-proxy annotations: kubernetes.io/tls-acme: \u0026#34;true\u0026#34; kubernetes.io/ingress.class: \u0026#34;nginx\u0026#34; spec: rules: - host: auth.example.com http: paths: - backend: serviceName: oauth2-proxy servicePort: 4180 path: /oauth2 tls: - hosts: - auth.example.com secretName: oauth-proxy-tls kubectl create -f oauth-ing.yml Test it! You can update ingress that we used while configuring nginx-ingress or create a new one:\nexample-ing.yml\napiVersion: extensions/v1beta1 kind: Ingress metadata: name: example annotations: kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx kubernetes.io/tls-acme: \u0026#39;true\u0026#39; ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-url: https://auth.example.com/oauth2/auth ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-signin: https://auth.example.com/oauth2/start?rd=https://$host$request_uri$is_args$args spec: rules: - host: service.example.com http: paths: - backend: serviceName: example-service servicePort: 80 path: / tls: - hosts: - service.example.com secretName: ing-tls kubectl apply -f example-ing.yml Then visit service.example.com and you will be redirected to GitHub authorization page:\nGitHub Authorization page And once you authenticate, you will have access to all your services under ingress that point to auth.example.com until cookie expires.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s it! Now you can put any of your internal services behind ingress with OAuth.\nResources Here is a list of resources that helped me to go through this proccess first time:\nhttps://eng.fromatob.com/post/2017/02/lets-encrypt-oauth-2-and-kubernetes-ingress/ https://www.midnightfreddie.com/oauth2-proxy.html https://thenewstack.io/single-sign-on-for-kubernetes-dashboard-experience/ ","permalink":"https://alik.page/posts/oauth2-proxy-for-kubernetes-services/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHello, folks!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this post, I will go through configuring \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/bitly/oauth2_proxy\"\u003eBitly OAuth2 proxy\u003c/a\u003e in a kubernetes cluster.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Oauth2 Proxy for Kubernetes Services"},{"content":"Today I migrated my blog to Hugo engine.

It\u0026rsquo;s been a long time since I have published the last post, but now I came back with short quickstart guide in Go.\nIn this tutorial, we will configure Go environment in VS Code and write our first program in Go.\nInstall Go The first thing that you need to do it\u0026rsquo;s to install Go on your computer. To do so, download installer for your operating system from here and then run the installer.\nConfigure GOPATH By language convention, Go developers store all their code in a single place called workspace. Go also puts dependency packages in the workspace. So, in order to Go perform correctly, we need to set GOPATH variable with the path to the workspace.\nMacOS and Linux Set the GOPATH envar with workspace\nexport GOPATH=$HOME/go Also, we need to add GOPATH/bin to PATH in order to run compiler Go programs:\nexport PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin Configure VS Code Install official Go extension.\nInstall delve debugger:\ngo get -u github.com/derekparker/delve/cmd/dlv I recommend you to add the following lines to your VS Code user settings:\nsettings.json\n{ \u0026#34;go.autocompleteUnimportedPackages\u0026#34;: true, \u0026#34;go.formatTool\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;gofmt\u0026#34; } Windows Create GOPATH envar:\nset GOPATH=c:\\Users\\%USERNAME%\\go Also, we need to add GOPATH\\bin to PATH in order to run compiler Go programs:\nset PATH=%PATH%;%GOPATH%\\bin Create project Move to your GOPATH/src directory. Create a directory for your project:\ncd $GOPATH/src mkdir -p github.com/alikhil/hello-world-with-go Open it using vscode:\ncode github.com/alikhil/hello-world-with-go Hello World Let\u0026rsquo;s create a file named program.go and put the following code there:\nprogram.go\npackage main import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; func main() { fmt.Println(\u0026#34;¬°Hola, mundo!\u0026#34;) } Run the program Finally, to run the program by pressing the F5 button in VS Code and you should see the message printed to Debug Console.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all! My congratulations, you have just written your first program in Go!\nTroubleshooting If you fail to run your program and there is some message like \u0026ldquo;Cannot find a path to go\u0026rdquo;. Try to add to your PATH envar with path directory where go binary is stored.\nFor example in MacOS I have added following line to my ~/.bash_profile:\nexport PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH ","permalink":"https://alik.page/posts/go-quickstart/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHi folks!\nIt\u0026rsquo;s been a long time since I have published the last post, but now I came back with short quickstart guide in \u003cstrong\u003eGo\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this tutorial, we will configure Go environment in VS Code and write our first program in Go.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Go Quickstart"}]
